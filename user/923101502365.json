For example, \"Hello, how are you doing today? /lang\". I will respond with the detected language.\n\nTo translate a text from one language to another, you can type the text you want to translate followed by the command \"/translate\" and then the target language code. For example, \"Bonjour, comment Ã§a va? /translate en\" will translate the text to English. You can find a list of language codes here: https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages."}]
